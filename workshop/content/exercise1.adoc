_Estimated Time: 5-10 Minutes_

There are two key resources you will be using in this lab:

* An OpenShift cluster with the OpenShift GitOps operator pre-installed.
* Your own fork of the workshop Git repository.

The next two sections will walk you through getting access to these resources.

== Fork the Lab Repository on GitHub

You'll need a GitHub account to complete this step. If you don't have one, go ahead and sign-up at https://github.com, then complete these steps:

. Login to https://github.com.
. Visit the lab repository at: https://github.com/evanshortiss/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt
. Use the **Fork** button in the upper-right corner of the GitHub UI to create your own copy of the repository.

You should now have a copy of the repository at a unique URL of your own, i.e `https://github.com/$YOUR_GITHUB_ID/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt`.

[NOTE]
====
You'll be asked to use this repository throughout the workshop. Make sure to always use *your forked* version, *not* the original one owned by evanshortiss on GitHub!

== Access your OpenShift Cluster

You'll be using your own OpenShift cluster throughout this lab. Your cluster is pre-configured with the **OpenShift Web Terminal** and **Red Hat OpenShift GitOps** Operators. You can think of Operators as addons to an OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster that provide it with extended features/capabilities:

    * The **Web Terminal** makes it easy to use pre-authenticated command-line tools (CLIs) to interact with the OpenShift APIs directly from the **OpenShift Web Console** in your web browser.
    * Pre-installing the **Red Hat OpenShift GitOps** operator saved a few minutes of time so you can fully focus on actually learning about GitOps instead of setting it up!

To access your cluster's **OpenShift Web Console**:

. Return to https://demo.redhat.com to obtain the URL, username, and password to access your cluster.
. Visit the cluster URL in a web browser, and select the *htpasswd_provider* login option when prompted.

. Login to your OpenShift cluster using the username and password provided by https://demo.redhat.com. The username should be `opentlc-mgr` and the password should be `r3dh4t1!`.

The **Overview** page of the OpenShift Web Console is displayed after a successful login. From here you can perform both administrative and developer-focused tasks. 

== Access the OpenShift Web Terminal

From the OpenShift Web Console you just accessed:

. Verify that a terminal icon **>_** is shown in the top-right corner of the OpenShift Web Console.
. Click the terminal icon. A new UI element will appear, and prepare a terminal session.
. Once the terminal session is ready type the `help` command, and press enter. This will display the pre-installed CLIs that are available in this lab environment.

. Run the `oc whoami` command in the Web Terminal and verify that the output is the same as the username you used to login to the OpenShift Web Console.
. Run the `oc project openshift-gitops` and `oc get pods` (or `kubectl get pods`) commands to change context to the pre-configured `openshift-gitops` namespace, and confirm the **OpenShift GitOps** components all display a status of *Running*.

== Summary

Nice work, you've successfully:

. Created a repository that will hold your cluster and application manifests.
. Signed into your OpenShift cluster.
. Learned how to access and use the OpenShift Web Terminal.
. Used the `oc` and `kubectl` CLIs to interact with resources on your cluster.
